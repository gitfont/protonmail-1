# protonmail
A simple, unofficial ‚úâÔ∏è +üñ•Client (Wrapper) for Protonmail for MacOS and Windows‚Ä¶

I bulit this Wrapper with NativeFier. A very simple Programm wich bulid from any URL a Wrapper. NativwFier is also availible for free on GitHub.

I built this app, because I use also Protonmail and find no really pretty or functionally Programm to use ProtonMail on Desktop with your own Settings and the possibillity to use notifications.

With this appltication it will work. You only need a ProtonMail Account‚Ä¶

## What you here see‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶are only the files, wich bulid the applications for Windows and MAc

## If you want to download the applications‚Ä¶
